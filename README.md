# Introduction
Hello, this bot was made for only one server use as it's a custom support bot which ranges in features. All the code is of free use and I require no credit as it's used for only one server use anyway. If you'd like to contribute to the project, you can create a pull request. 

You can use this bot in your own server if you feel as it offers ModMail, Disboard bumping reminder, welcome messages, boost messages, giveaways, pushing suggestions to GitHub and fun for your community server.
